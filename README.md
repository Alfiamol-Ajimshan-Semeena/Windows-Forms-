## Introduction 
The purpose of this project is designing a simple web browser application with core 
functionalities such as web navigation, favorites, history tracking, homepage customization, and 
downloading URLs in bulk. The application will be designed to offer minimal browsing with ease 
of use in managing favorite pages and browsing history. Below is a project where one has to 
develop a browser based on a GUI, which can manipulate and store persistent data by utilizing 
an SQLite database for favorites without any additional set-up of the database. The assumptions 
that would be taken into consideration in this project are: There is an active internet connection. 
The operating system should be Windows. Hard and software must be compatible with.NET.
